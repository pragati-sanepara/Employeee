# Template Driven Form

angular procides two different ways to collect and validate data from user.

1. Template-Driven Form
    - In this all work should be done in template, that's why it's called template driven form
3. Model-Driven Form (Reactive Form)
    - big form and more validation , at that time we prefer this 
   
   
## Template-driven form
  
  - Import FormsModule in add.module.ts
  - suitable for simple scenarios and fail for complex scenarios
  
  Note: use both in same application
